# healthcare-clinical-trials-pipeline
Build a healthcare data pipeline on Azure using Python, PySpark, and SQL. Ingest clinical trials data, transform it with big data tools, and analyze it using Azure Synapse and Power BI. Perfect for Data Engineering portfolios.
# Healthcare Clinical Trials Data Engineering Pipeline (Azure)

This project demonstrates a full-scale Data Engineering pipeline for processing and analyzing healthcare clinical trial data using Azure cloud services and big data tools.

The pipeline ingests XML data from [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/), transforms it with PySpark, stores it in Azure Data Lake, and enables interactive analytics via Azure Synapse and Power BI.

##  Technologies Used
- **Python** (for ingestion)
- **PySpark** (for big data transformation)
- **Azure Data Lake Gen2**
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**
- **SQL**
- **Power BI** (for visualization)

---

##  Project Highlights
- Ingested 400k+ clinical trial records from public XML sources
- Converted semi-structured XML into clean Parquet format using PySpark
- Stored and queried large datasets with Azure Synapse external tables
- Built dynamic Power BI dashboards showing:
  - Trial status (Active vs Completed)
  - Study types
  - Trends over time

This project is ideal for showcasing modern data engineering skills using real-world healthcare data. ðŸ’¼
